<p>History</p>
<p>The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 (T20) cricket league in India, organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).[1] Founded in 2007, it features ten city-based franchise teams.[2] The IPL is the most popular and richest cricket league in the world. It is held annually between March and May. It has an exclusive window in the Future Tours Programme of the International Cricket Council, resulting in fewer international tours occurring during the seasons.[3] It is also the most viewed Indian sports event, per the Broadcast Audience Research Council.[4][5]

In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event to broadcast live on YouTube.[6][7] In 2014, it ranked sixth in attendance among all sports leagues.[8] Inspired by the success of the IPL, other Indian sports leagues have been established.[a][11][12] The IPL is the second-richest sports league in the world by per-match value, after the National Football League.[13] In 2023, the league sold its media rights for the next four seasons for US$6.4 billion to Viacom18 and Star Sports,[14] which meant that each IPL match was valued at $13.4 million.[15] As of 2025, there have been 18 seasons of the tournament. The current champions are the Royal Challengers Bengaluru, who won the 2025 season after defeating the Punjab Kings in the final.</p>
